      <h2>Why:</h2>
      <p>We started this company because we love candles, but we wanted more fun shapes, colors and sizes of candles.
      As college students we were able to find our true love for candles during our long study stretches, and especially during our decompressing time.
      We found that calming, non-overpowering sent have a very positive reactions when helping us manage stress, we are founders wanted to pass on our saving grace to everyone but added some special personalization’s</p>

      <h2>What:</h2>
      <p>When purchasing a candle, you first pick out what sent you want. 
      Next, you pick out the wick (flat, square, cored, wooden), type you would like. After that you pick the size/shape of jar you would like the wax poured in.
      finally you will be able to pick what color you would like the wax to be.</p>

      <h2>How we got started:</h2>
      <p>Camryn Lesser and I (Cassidy Price), are co-owners/founders of this company.
      We started off as sorority sisters at Simpson College and turned into best friends over the years.
      Shortly into our friendship we realized that we both shared a similar passion for candles, and eventually learned how to make our own for fun.
      We would make them and sell them to peers to help raise money for our sorority, Pi Beta Phi. 
      By our senior year we had a steady flow of customers and have now decided to take our small busy to the next level!</p>
